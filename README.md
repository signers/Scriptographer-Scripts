# Scriptographer-Scripts

A collection of scripts I've wrote for the Scriptographer Illustrator plugin.


## Lsystems.js
An Lsystem generator that uses turtle interpretation of strings. 

### It supports: 

* deterministic and context-free (DOL-systems)
* non-deterministic (Stochastic L-systems)
* branching and non-branching (Bracketed OL-systems)

### Features:

* Includes 24 Lsystem presets
* GUI to switch through / modify the presets
* Basic styling

### Features to be added:

The ability to add your own presets through the GUI.

A decorations palette to add shapes / type with or without the lines.

Context sensitive and parametric support maybe.
